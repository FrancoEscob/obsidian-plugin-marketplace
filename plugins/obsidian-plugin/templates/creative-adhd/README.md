# Creative ADHD Templates

Templates optimized for creative, non-technical users with ADHD.

## Design Philosophy

These templates are designed around ADHD-specific challenges:

### 1. **Context Blindness**
**Problem:** Forgetting what you were doing when you return to a project.
**Solution:** Every template has a "Next Step" section that's always visible.

### 2. **Overwhelm**
**Problem:** Too many fields or options cause decision paralysis.
**Solution:** Minimal required fields, simple structure, visual clarity.

### 3. **Racing Thoughts**
**Problem:** Ideas come fast and need quick capture before they're lost.
**Solution:** `quick-capture.md` - dump thoughts in seconds.

### 4. **Energy Fluctuation**
**Problem:** Energy levels vary throughout the day.
**Solution:** Every template tracks energy (🔋 high, ⚡ medium, 🪫 low) so you can match tasks to your state.

### 5. **Loss of Progress Awareness**
**Problem:** Hard to see how much progress you've made.
**Solution:** Session summaries auto-track what you accomplished.

## Template Descriptions

### `daily-note.md`
Daily note with:
- Energy check-in (match tasks to energy)
- One main focus (not a huge list)
- Quick wins (small, dopamine-friendly tasks)
- Tomorrow's next step (never start with blank slate)

### `quick-capture.md`
Ultra-fast thought capture:
- No required fields (speed over perfection)
- Just: what's the thought?
- Optional: why does it matter?
- Organize later with `/process-inbox`

### `session.md`
Auto-generated by `session-end` hook:
- What got done
- What's pending
- **EXACT next step** (where to start, what file, what to do)
- Energy needed for next step
- Blockers/questions

This is the KEY file for ADHD users - solves context blindness completely.

### `project.md`
Simple project tracking:
- What/why in plain language
- Main goals (not overwhelming sub-tasks)
- Next tiny step (always visible at top)
- Auto-links to session files
- Blockers section (capture friction immediately)

### `idea.md`
Idea capture and tracking:
- One sentence summary (force clarity)
- Why it's cool (maintain excitement)
- Status checklist (from 🌱 idea → 📦 project)
- Easy to link to related ideas

## Visual Language

### Emojis Used Consistently

- 🎯 = Focus/Goal/Target
- ✅ = Completed/Done
- ⏳ = Pending/Waiting
- 💡 = Idea/Insight
- 🚧 = Blocker/Problem
- 📝 = Notes
- 🔗 = Links/Related
- 🔋 = High energy
- ⚡ = Medium energy
- 🪫 = Low energy
- 🚀 = Project/Launch
- 💭 = Quick thought

These visual cues help ADHD brains quickly parse information without reading full sentences.

## Energy-Based Task Matching

Each template tracks energy because ADHD energy is non-linear:

**🔋 High Energy Tasks:**
- Complex problem solving
- Learning new concepts
- Architecting/designing
- Making important decisions

**⚡ Medium Energy Tasks:**
- Writing documentation
- Organizing notes
- Testing/debugging known issues
- Routine implementation

**🪫 Low Energy Tasks:**
- Processing inbox
- Reading documentation
- Updating status
- Light editing/formatting

## How Sessions Work (The Magic)

When you work with Claude on a project:

1. **You start:** Claude shows you exactly where you left off (from `LAST_SESSION.md`)
2. **You work:** Build, create, solve problems
3. **You finish:** Claude asks "Any notes before we wrap up?"
4. **Auto-save:** `session-end` hook creates `_CONTEXT/sessions/2026-01-12.md` with:
   - What you accomplished
   - What's pending
   - **EXACT next step** (file to open, line to edit, what to do)
   - Energy needed
   - Any blockers

5. **Next time:** Claude reads this file and says "Last time we connected the database. Next step is adding email validation in `src/auth.js` line 45. This needs 🔋 high energy. Ready?"

**No more "wait, what was I doing?"**

## Example Session Flow

```
Day 1 - 10am (🔋 High energy):
You: "Let's work on the health app login"
Claude: "Great! Where do we start?"
[Work happens, build login form]
Claude: "Want to save context before we end?"
You: "Yes"
→ Creates: _CONTEXT/sessions/2026-01-12-10am.md
→ Next step: "Connect login form to database"

Day 2 - 2pm (🪫 Low energy):
You: [Opens Claude]
Claude: "Welcome back! Last session (yesterday 10am):
  ✅ Built login form UI
  ⏳ Pending: Connect to database

  🎯 Next step: Open `src/api/auth.js` and add the connection code.

  Note: This needs 🔋 high energy (database work).
  Your energy is 🪫 low right now.

  Want to tackle this, or should we do something lighter?"

You: "What's a low energy task?"
Claude: "You could process your INBOX or update project docs. Both are 🪫 low energy."
```

See how the system **adapts to energy** and **preserves perfect context**?

## Tips for Using These Templates

1. **Don't overthink it:** Just fill what you know, skip the rest
2. **Energy tracking is key:** Always mark your energy, it helps you see patterns
3. **Next step is sacred:** ALWAYS write a specific next step before ending
4. **Quick capture liberally:** Don't lose thoughts, dump them fast
5. **Trust the system:** The hooks auto-save context, you don't have to remember

## For Olga Specifically

This system is your "external brain":
- You don't have to remember what you were doing → `session-end` remembers
- You don't have to track progress → `/project-status` shows everything
- You don't have to organize constantly → `/process-inbox` handles it
- You don't have to worry about losing context → `LAST_SESSION.md` has it all

**Your only job:** Create and build. The system handles memory.
